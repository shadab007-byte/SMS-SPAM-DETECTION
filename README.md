# SMS Spam Detection System

## 📋 **Project Overview**
This **SMS Spam Detection** system uses machine learning to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham**. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and employs algorithms like **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression** to accurately filter spam messages, ideal for real-time SMS screening.

## 🛠️ **Technologies**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **NLTK**, **Matplotlib**
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 📊 **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project, `train.csv`, contains 5,574 labeled SMS messages. Columns include:
- **label**: Spam or Ham.
- **message**: Content of the SMS.

The dataset is included for direct use in model training and evaluation.

## 🔍 **Approach**
1. **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
2. **Modeling:** Training models like **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.
3. **Evaluation:** Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
4. **Visualization:** Exploring message length, word frequencies, and model performance metrics.

---

## 📈 **Results**
The **Naive Bayes** model achieved **97% accuracy**. Logistic Regression also performed effectively, making both models viable for SMS spam classification.

## 🚀 **Future Work**
- Explore **deep learning** models (e.g., **LSTM**, **BERT**) for improved accuracy.
- Optimize models via **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Expand the dataset and add support for multiple languages.
- Deploy as a real-time web or mobile app.
